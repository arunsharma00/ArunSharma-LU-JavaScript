//Question 1 
console.log(1 + "2" + "2");//output is 122 ,because 1 is integer and "2","2" is a string,so + operator works here as concatenation operator so it concatenate(join the strings)
1+"2"+"2" into 122.
console.log(1 + +"2" + "2");//output is 32 ,because 1 is integer and "2" is string but before "2" there is a (+) operator ,so that string +"2" becomes as a integer 2. so 1+2=3
and therfore 1+ +"2"+"2" will concatenate(+) into 32.
console.log(1 + -"1" + "2");//output is 02 , because 1 is integer and "1" is string but before that there is (-) operator, so that string -"1" becomes as a integer -1.so 1-1=0
and therefore 1+-"1"+"2" will concatenate(+) into 02.
console.log(+"1" + "1" + "2");//output is 122, because "1" is a string but before that +"1" is a integer, so that string becomes as a integer 1 and "1","2" are strings.so it
concatenate 1+"1"+"2" into 122. 
console.log( "A" - "B" + "2");//output is NaN2 ,because if we are trying to use any operator expect "+" on string then it will display "NaN".And if we used "+" then it will 
concatenate two string,"+" means concatenation.So "A"-"B" will be "NaN" and concate(+) 2 will produce "NaN2".
console.log( "A" - "B" + 2);//output is NaN ,because if we are trying to use any operator expect "+" on string then it will display "NaN" and 2 is a integer.So,therefore
"A"-"B"+2 will be "NaN".
